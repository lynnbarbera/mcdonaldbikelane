	Hundreds of community members have signed an online petition against a proposed bike lane in Windsor Terrace, claiming it will increase traffic and collisions on this already dangerous and busy truck route. </p>

<p>The nearly 300 petitioners said they support new cycling infrastructure and have proposed an alternate route: one-way bike lanes along East Third and East Fourth Streets, instead of the Department of Transportation’s proposed lane on McDonald Avenue, a major thoroughfare.
</p>
<p>
Those in favor of the bike lane and those opposed overwhelmingly agree that the road is unsafe and that the Department of Transportation should take action to curb crashes.
</p>
<p>
Between 2020 and 2024, nine bicyclists were injured along this stretch of McDonald, according to New York City street safety initiative Vision Zero. A nearby stretch of Prospect Avenue recorded a singular crash/collision during the same time period, the project found.
</p>
<p>
“So [the Department of Transportation] is looking at that and they're saying, ‘How can we turn this street into a safer one?’” said Alexa Sledge, communications director at nonprofit advocacy group Transportation Alternatives. “One of the best and most reviewed ways to do that is putting up a protected bike lane.” 
</p>
<p>
Protected bike lanes include a physical separation between bikers and traffic, such as a parking lane or barrier. These lanes reduced crash risk by 34 percent in a Department of Transportation study from 2021.
</p>
<p>
The department delivered its proposal to Community Board 7 in June, but has yet to schedule a public meeting to engage with feedback from residents, according to Katie Walsh of the board’s transportation committee.
</p>
<p>
With no clear plans to move forward with the proposed bike lane or an alternative, the transportation department is running out of time to comply with a 2019 City Council ordinance mandating that the city build 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026.
</p>
<p>
The department has installed just 97.9 miles of protected bike lane to date, according to Transportation Alternatives.
</p>
<p>
No cycling routes currently run through Windsor Terrace between 10th Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway. Bikers seeking to travel between Prospect Park South or Kensington to Windsor Terrace or South Slope without looping around the whole of Prospect Park must do so without protection. 
</p>
<p>
Windsor Terrace resident and cyclist Martha Rose said she refuses to bike on McDonald Avenue out of fear. 
</p>
<p>
The road is “a menace to my life,” she said. 
</p>
<p>
To install the two-way protected bike lane, the Department of Transportation would remove a lane of traffic in each direction, bringing McDonald Avenue to two lanes from four. Petitioners said the road is already congested and losing lanes would exacerbate the problem. 
</p>
<p>
The stretch of McDonald between 10th Avenue and Fort Hamilton saw 16,887 vehicles each day on average in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation. A similar stretch of road across Greenwood Cemetery clocked only 8,330 vehicles per day last year.
</p>
<p>
Petitioners said they’re familiar with the numerous threats along McDonald Avenue.
</p>
<p>
“It’s never been safe,” said Troy Martin, the Windsor Terrace resident who created the petition against the proposed bike lane. He said his child was struck by an electric bike crossing McDonald when a semi-trailer was blocking the nearest intersection. 
</p>
<p>
“By increasing the amount of truck traffic there, and then mixing Citi Bikes and the buses on top of that, it just becomes even more dangerous,” Martin said. 
</p>
<p>
Martin, who said he bikes and drives in the city, said his alternative route along East Third and Fourth Streets would “create a longer, safer bike route.” He said that local cyclists and delivery bikers already use these streets to avoid McDonald Avenue. 
</p>
<p>
The government mandates a minimum rideable width of 6.5 to 7 feet along one-way protected bike lanes. East Third and East Fourth Streets are just 30 feet wide — too narrow to accommodate street parking, a car lane and a protected bike lane.
</p>
<p>
Conventional bike lanes without a protective barrier would suffice on these residential streets, according to Martin. 
</p>
<p>
McDonald Avenue could stand to lose some of its width, said Sledge of Transportation Alternatives.
</p>
<p>
“The best way to reduce speeding is to create a narrow road, and the best way to create a narrow road is putting in protected bike lanes,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Three out of every four vehicles drove above the speed limit on Prospect Park West before a bike lane was installed, according to a Department of Transportation radar study. After installation, only one out of every five vehicles exceeded the speed limit, it found. 
</p>
<p>
But some community members said the city’s emphasis on reducing car speed misses their point, which is to boost cyclist safety without increasing vehicle congestion. 
</p>
<p>
“They say, listen, it'll be safer for everyone, because it's been shown that if we put bike lanes in, it slows traffic,” said Patricia Jones, a Windsor Terrace resident who said her adult children are cyclists. “No fucking shit. Of course it's gonna slow traffic. To a stop.”
</p>
<p>
The petition against the McDonald Avenue proposal is not anti-bike, Jones insisted. “It’s about safety.”
</p>
<p>
The Department of Transportation declined to make staff available for an interview.
